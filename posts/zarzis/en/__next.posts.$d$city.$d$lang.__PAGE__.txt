Perhaps better to focus on local spots. Plage de Zarzis is the main beach, and there are sand dunes right in the city. I think there's a place called \"Sahara Beach\" but it's not actual Sahara. Actually, Zarzis has a desert area called \"Dunes of Zarzis\" nearby. For example, the \"Grand Erg Oriental\" is further, but there are local dunes.
